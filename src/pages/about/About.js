            Hi, my name is Yangtsel Sherap. 
          </p>  
          <p>
            I am a front-end developer for user-oriented digital products based out of Brooklyn, New York. With 3+ years of prior experience in product management, my work spans creating feature-rich user interfaces within the health-tech and media spaces. I am interested in the confluence between technology, infrastructure, and design and how these forces shape the world around us.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interests include collecting rocks, visiting places via google maps, hiking, gardening, and making music.
