        Connect Four was created during the third week of my Software Engineering Immersive course through General Assembly. Prior to enrolling in this program, I had little to no experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I wanted to use this project to gain a foundational understanding of functions, loops, and event listeners, all of which have been incorporated into my code.        </div>
